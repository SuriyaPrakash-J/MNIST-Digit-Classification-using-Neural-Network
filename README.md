# MNIST-Digit-Classification-using-Neural-Network
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to build, train, and evaluate a model that can accurately recognize digits (0â€“9) from grayscale images.
